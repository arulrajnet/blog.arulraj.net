**Why i am moving to Linux in my home pc**

****

For the past 3 years i have used pirated windows xp os in my home pc.
But i have faced lot of problems like system very slow, Blue screen and
more hectic thing is virus softwars. So i want to move any red-hat
family, because i have some good experience with red-hat family os's
like centOS rather then Ubuntu. I have the CentOS 5.0 dvd that was
downloaded before an year. When install using that dvd Testing Disk is
not completed some files are corrupted. I have fedora 7 dvd then
successfully installed on Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz 2 cpu
processor Intel 815 motherborad. I have the softwares for windows os
only not for redhat rpm files.At that time
`wine <http://www.winehq.org/>`__\ (run Windows programs on Unix)
software is help me a lot. I installed Openoffice and vlc using wine
those are working fine. The `mplayer <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/>`__\ and
`ffmpeg <http://ffmpeg.org/>`__ are used for my video and audio
manipulation and playing. gnome-mplayer gives me the graphical toolbar
option for mplayer. I used `GIMP <http://www.gimp.org/>`__\ for image
manipulation. I have the Netbeans distibution dvd it has java6 sdk and
netbeans it enable me to develop a jsp pages and other things.
Opensource softwares are rocking then why i used that pirated os's
(windows).. Till now i am not face any critical problems on
`fedora <http://fedoraproject.org/>`__. Thanks to the fedora team.
