I have GIT version management tool for versioningÂ and using gitolite for user and project management within git. Will tell about this gitolite story in a seperate post.

Here we are going to learn how to copy commits from your master to branch.

Basically I am a linux enthusiast so I will explain everthing here in commends. Feel free to use git commends ðŸ˜„

-  First you have to check where you are now.

.. code-block:: bash

	git branch -a

That **\*** will where you are. Now I am in Master branch.

-  Create a new branch and move to that created branch

.. code-block:: bash

	git branch <branch_name>
	git checkout <branch_name>

If you are already created branch. No need create branch just git checkout

-  Once again confirm Are you in correct branch.

.. code-block:: bash

	git branch -a

-  Pick up the commits to this branch

.. code-block:: bash

	git cherry-pick <first_some_character_of_commit_hash>
	Ex: git cherry-pick d1c4b9a5a21e3d09cae

-  How to get the hash tag of commits

git log

You can get the has tag from here.

-  Then Switch back to master

.. code-block:: bash

	git checkout master

-  For push this branch to remote server

.. code-block:: bash

	git push origin <branch_name>

-  For delete the locally created branch

.. code-block:: bash

	git branch -D <branch_name>
