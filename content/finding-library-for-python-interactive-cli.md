My requirement is to Ask question to user and the user select the answer from choices. I want the cli should be in python because the libraries the cli interact with is already developed python. 

First I have found below from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/spphji/recommended_library_for_an_interactive_cli/){:target="_blank"}

[PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer){:target="_blank"}

Its fits my requirement. But it seems not maintained. So searching for other [alternatives](https://www.google.com/search?q=pyinquirer+alternatives){:target="_blank"}.

Found the below awesome list

[Awesome CLI Frameworks in python](https://github.com/shadawck/awesome-cli-frameworks?tab=readme-ov-file#python){:target="_blank"}

Then short listed these 

* [Python Prompt Toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit){:target="_blank"}
* [PyInquirer](https://github.com/CITGuru/PyInquirer){:target="_blank"}
* [InquirerPy](https://github.com/kazhala/InquirerPy){:target="_blank"}
* [Questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary){:target="_blank"}

My intuition says, I am mostly go with `Questionary` . Lets see. Will update the post after completed. 

Got to know about

* Text User Interface - TUI
* Seems python prompt toolkit is most [widely used](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/PROJECTS.rst){:target="_blank"} and actively maintained. 
* [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/){:target="_blank"} for NodeJS
* [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra){:target="_blank"} for Golang

Created Git [CLI](https://github.com/stars/arulrajnet/lists/cli){:target="_blank"} list.
