It has been ~10 years since my last post. Every time I am thinking of writing back again, these are the questions in front of me


### ❓ Why no post ?

* Why should I write this as blog post ?. Just twitter/x post is sufficient right?
* Does this really helpful to someone ?
* Its just a small thing, just a little effort anyone can get to know themselves.
* Does my employer like it or not ?
* blah.. blah.. blah..

A little bit background, In the past decade

* Get married and Got two kids. More responsibility and I really enjoy spend time with my family.
* I work for an organization called IoTium Systems Private Ltd., I really love what I am doing there.

Its been really hard to find time for this apart form Family + Work 😃

## ⏰ Why now?

Recently I went through a minor surgery. Nothing to worry. But, It made me think in multiple dimensions.

* Writing is clear my thoughts.
* Its for me. Not for anyone.
* Everything has my perspective even its small thing.
* As long as not exposing confidential information, its fine.

Also I am big believer of Gandhian Thoughts.. Here are some of quotes related to that

> கைகளால் ஒன்றை உருவாக்குபவன் தன் அகத்தை அதன் வழியாகச் சீரமைத்துக் கொள்கிறான்.
- காந்தி

English Translations are

>Who builds something with his hands aligns his inner self through it.
- Gandhi

>Even in the simplest way you can rock the world.
- Gandhi

The another mantra I learned is `Dedicate`🧑‍🤝‍🧑. Even though 10/20% less in quality its fine. Empower the others.

## 🎆 What next?

FYI, I quit social media long back except [twitter](https://x.com/arulrajnet) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/arulrajnet/). Even though I am not write on internet. I write a lot as confluence pages, JIRA comment and PR comments. I have been expert in many things in these days. When I look back I have been deep understanding of many things, The first principles. So I want to write those things.

Expect a post sooner not later.
