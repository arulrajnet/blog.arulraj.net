Now again windows stuff\... I am using windows OS in office ðŸ˜Œ\... This
post is about a simple tweaks about running multiple mysql instance in
one windows machine. Each instance runs in a different port and behaves
as a dedicated standalone server.

**Why multiple instances..?**

> If you are a developer its for you. Sometimes you need to test your
> application with different type of data (like QA, Production) to
> replicate some error and etc., At that time no need to drop your old
> database and put the new one. Just use this and change the db port in
> your application configuration. This will be helpful for system
> administrators also to provide database service to his users.

**Requirement:**

-   mysql installed windows machine
-   Administrative privilegesÂ for that machine

For me mysql installed location is e:\\softs\\mysql\\

**Steps:**

Create \[instances\\production\] with in mysql installed directory (you
can create anywhere). Better do everything in command prompt.Â 

``` text
e:
cd \softs\mysql\
md instances\production
```

Copy your data and share folder to production folder

``` text
copy data instances\production\
copy share instances\production\
```

To create your custom ini file copy my.ini file and edit

``` text
copy my.ini instances\production.ini
```

## Edit Production.ini

-   change port as 3307 under \[client\] and \[mysqld\] section
-   Change basedir and datadir in that ini file

[Click Here](http://files.arulraj.net/code/database/production.ini) for
my production.ini file

Now add your custom ini in system starup

``` text
mysqld --install mysqldproduction --defaults-file="E:\softs\mysql\instances\production.ini"
```

Now goto Control Panel â†’ Administrative tools â†’ Services. Then search
for \'mysqldproduction\' and start service.

OR

``` text
net start mysqldproduction
```

You may think all is done. But after this only I faced problems.

**Cannot find the file specified:**

When I try to start that service \"System error has occurred. The system
cannot find the file specified.\"

There is registry changes needed to fix that issue

-   To open registry editor Start â†’ Run
-   Type \'regedit\' and enter.
-   Next, browse to the registry key
    named:Â HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\mysqldproduction\\ImagePath
-   Now you can see there is *no double quotes* in that \--defaults-file
    so change ImagePath to

``` bash
"E:\softs\mysql\bin\mysqld" --defaults-file="E:\softs\mysql\instances\production.ini" mysqldproduction
```

Now start that service.

Keep watching Event Viewer. That is the best place to get debug
information. Again I am getting error while starting server

[![Event viewer for

**Can\'t find messagefile:**

The error is

``` text
System error 1067 has occurred.
The process terminated unexpectedly.
Can't find messagefile 'E:\softs\mysql\instances\production\share\errmsg.sys'
```

**Fix:**

> Just copy errmsg.sys file from \[MYSQL_BASE\]shareenglishto that
> instancesproductionshare folder

Now everything is fine. Service will start successfully.
