Hi all,

My name is `Arulraj Venni <https://www.linkedin.com/in/arulrajnet/>`__, but you can call me Arul or AJ. I work at a software company and have experience with various technologies. I enjoy working on open source projects and software. This blog is where I share my past experiences, experiments, knowledge, and the technical problems I've encountered. I mostly focus on topics related to Linux and Java, and occasionally, I discuss general topics as well.

Contact me at **contact AT arulraj.net**
