You know I am the big fan of docker compose (fig ðŸ˜¸). I am the advanced user in compose and swarm. Deployed swarm based cluster for different product and its handles millions of request every day. 
## The requirement

Here is the example about how we can use a single YAML file for docker services and configuration. We don't need separate file or folder maintained in the repo. Just single `docker-compose.yml` file is enough. All the configuration is with in that as inline content. 

Lets dive into the topic. 

* We want to deploy a nginx proxy.
* Its has a configuration file.
* It has HTML file to serve.
* It has a image file to serve.

## Single YAML

How I can define the inline config file

```yaml
configs:
  nginx.conf:
    content: |
      your config file content
```


Refer this [doc](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/231b09c30d339e950c0da17fe5bdc793366b8fde/08-configs.md){:target="_blank"} in GitHub. 

Here is the compose yaml file for nginx serve the html file content. 

```yaml
name: nginx-inline
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.27.1
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    configs:
      - source: index.html
        target: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
configs:
  index.html:
    content: |
      <!doctype html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>Hello nginx</title>
          <meta charset="utf-8" />
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1>
            Hello arulraj.net!
          </h1>
        </body>
      </html>
```

Bring up the system using `docker-compose up -d`. Then access [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Now you see the page like this.

The index.html loaded successfully. 


## Environmental interpolation

You can do the [environmental interpolation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/interpolation/){:target="_blank"} in `docker-compose.yml` file in a usual way. 

* The good old `.env` file
* OR use `export` before ran `docker-compose up -d`

The following content has `WELCOME_MESSAGE` in the index.html

```yaml
configs:
  index.html:
    content: |
      <!doctype html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>Hello nginx</title>
          <meta charset="utf-8" />
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1>
            ${WELCOME_MESSAGE:-Hello, World!}
          </h1>
        </body>
      </html>
```


Then

```
export WELCOME_MESSAGE="Hello, Arul!"
docker-compose up -d
```

## Store environmental variable as config file

Expose the host machine environment variable inside the container as config file. 

```yaml
name: nginx-inline
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:1.21.1
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    configs:
      - source: path.txt
        target: /usr/share/nginx/html/path.txt
configs:
  path.txt:
    environment: "PATH"
```

Here we expose the host machine `PATH` env as `path.txt`

## Binary file

The binary file converted as `base64` and can be used. 

But this is not supported in compose spec as like kubernetes. 


Will update this post once its supported.
