There are many ways to do this. I am following these two ways

* WhatsApp Web Way
* QR Code Way

## WhatsApp Web

I am from Chennai, India. Here WhatsApp messenger app is widely used. So this app is installed by default. 

We can access the messenger from PC via browser. [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com)

In WhatsApp, you can chat against your own profile. You can use that for text copy and file transfer.

## QR Code

Use any online QR code generator to copy text. Then scan it using your camera app. My personal favorite is [zxing](https://zxing.appspot.com/generator/)

Personally I don't want to install any extra software/app in my pc or phone. That is the reason I am following this.

What is your way of doing this?
