I have GIT version management tool for versioningÂ and using gitolite for
user and project management within git. Will tell about this gitolite
story in a seperate post.

Here we are going to learn how to copy commits from your master to
branch.

Basically I am a linux enthusiast so I will explain everthing here in
commends. Feel free to use git commends :)

-  First you have to check where you are now.

| git branch -a
|  That \* will where you are. Now I am in Master branch.

-  Create a new branch and move to that created branch

| git branch <branch\_name>
|  git checkout <branch\_name>

If you are already created branch. No need create branch just git
checkout

-  Once again confirm Are you in correct branch.

git branch -a

-  Pick up the commits to this branch

| git cherry-pick <first\_some\_character\_of\_commit\_hash>
|  Ex: git cherry-pick d1c4b9a5a21e3d09cae

-  How to get the hash tag of commits

git log

You can get the has tag from here.

-  Then Switch back to master

git checkout master

-  For push this branch to remote server

git push origin <branch\_name>

-  For delete the locally created branch

git branch -D <branch\_name>
