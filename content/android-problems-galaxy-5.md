Here some of the problems are hardware dependent and some are OS
dependent. But still those are not fixed in the latest version of
android. But still they have major share in smartphone
[market](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20051610-17.html) ðŸ˜ƒ

The problems in my mobile only. It may vary for your mobile. Some
problems are resolved and some could not.

**My Specification:**

``` text
Model - Samsung GT-I5503 a.k.a Samsung Galaxy 5
Version - Android 2.1 Eclair
Firmware - 2.1-Update1
```

Can not delete multiple contacts:

There is no option to delete more than one contacts. If you want to
delete 10 contacts you should go with one by one.

Doesn\'t sync with google contacts groups:

I have contact groups in gmail contacts, but its not synced with my
mobile contacts. Now all gmail contacts in one group.

Contact image not shown when dialing:

The contact image is not shown when I calling to someone. The image came
once they attend the call. But not a problem in incoming call, always
image came.

The most of the contacts related problems seems to be solved in Froyo. I
need to update my OS version. But samsung does not provide update for
Galaxy 5 ðŸ˜”

Can not connect with ad-hoc network:

This is the most known android
[issue](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=82). If you
use [wifi
analyzer](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer)
it will detect the ad-hoc network. but in the Settings â†’ Wireless and
Networks not even detect the network.

Could not detect your location:

I solved this problem. When i try to to find \"My Location\"
inÂ Latitude. It always says \"Your current location is temporarily
unavailable.\"

Goto Settings â†’ Location and Security â†’ Check both Use wireless networks
and Use GPS satellites. Thats it

Sometimes showing wrong time:

Sometimes my mobile shows correct time and sometimes it shows current
time + 5:30 hours. Finally i solved this. The issue because of getting
the time from GSM network.

Goto Settings â†’ Date and Time â†’ uncheck the Automatic

Proxy only for browser not for applications:

Actually I set proxy for wifi network, But the proxy is works only for
browser not for application you installed.

To Set proxy Goto Settings â†’ Wireless and networks â†’ WiFi Settings â†’
Advanced

Sync Issue:

If any issue came in syncing. That application is not working any more.
I had a problem in syncing in calendar. After that calendar application
is not opening. Its works after successfully synced. For sync Goto
Setting â†’ Accounts and Sync

Bluetooth headset is not supported:

There is no option to connect my bluetooth headset. Even my LG KG195
supports bluetooth headset. ðŸ˜œ

Auto Reboot:

This is a big headache. it will automatically reboot if more process run
at a same time :oops:

Finally I came to aÂ conclusion I need to update my OS version and
samsung firmware. It will solve most of my problem.Â  Anyone successfully
update OS / firmware for Galaxy 5..?

Last 6 months this post draft today only got the time to finish and
post. ðŸ˜„
