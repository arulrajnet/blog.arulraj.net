Now we are going to learn about how to unlock huawei datacard / dongle /
modem. This is totally free. You are going to unlock by yourself without
paying any single penny of yours. Some websites claiming money for this.
Do not follow them. You can do by yourself without anyone help. Believe
in yours. ðŸ˜„

**Why we need to unlock..? what is the use of that..?**

If you are bought this device from any internet service provider they
locked that device with particular network SIM. So you can\'t use any
other network with this device. If you unlocked that device you can
enjoy 3g with any SIM.

I bought this device e303s from Aircel in chennai for Rs.1600 - 3
month - 6GB - prepaid

**What is needed to unlock..? Its hard to get one..?**

Basically you need an **unlock code** for that. Earlier huawei modems
are using different algorithm. That is easy to hack. Even some software
tools available to find out the code. Now all modems follow new
algorithm.

**How can I found my device follows newÂ algorithm or old algorithm..?**

If you modem IMEI starts with **86\*\* .**Then that is the new
algorithm. This tutorial for new algorithm modems only.

**How to get the unlock code of modem..?**

There are two ways to get your unlock code. Be prepared with your IMEI
no of device.

## First one:

Post your IMEI no in this forum thread
[http://forum.gsmhosting.com/vbb/f88/huawei-unlock-codes-request-only-here-v3-1707247/index100.html](http://bit.ly/1fTA4iX)Â .
You can get your unlock code instantly. Below is mine.

## Second one:

Follow this link
[http://huaweicodecalculator.com/new-algo/](http://bit.ly/1fTA0zM)

-   Login with your Google account
-   Give your IMEI no and model then press calculate button
-   Then G+1 that (similar to like in FB)
-   Then it will show your unlock code. Below is mine
-   Use **NEW ALGO CODE** if your IMEI start with 86\* (For e303s use
    New Algo code)

**So I got the unlock code what next..?**

Download Below files

-   Mobile Partner -Â [Mobile Partner.zip](http://bit.ly/1crfGWT)
-   Dashboard Update -
    [UTPS23.001.07.04.910_mobile_partner_dashboard_update.zip](http://bit.ly/1crfYNu)

## Steps:

-   Extract Mobile Partner and run setup.exe
-   Open Mobile partnerÂ Once installation done.
-   Plug the unsupported SIM in your datacard
-   Plug your datacard into PC
-   Now you can see the popup for enter unlock code.

[![Unlock code
popup](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZyN4J1ONsdM/UmbTJ2cMQqI/AAAAAAAAVbc/u_8icceEWXw/s320/asking+code.PNG)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZyN4J1ONsdM/UmbTJ2cMQqI/AAAAAAAAVbc/u_8icceEWXw/s1600/asking+code.PNG)

Then enter your code and press Ok. wait for sometime. Now it will detect
your new network. If not try again.

Note: You can attempt only 10 times.

Now you can enjoy with any network. I tested with Tata DoCoMo, BSNL,
AirTel and Vodafone

Yeah you are done\...!!!! Congrats Mate\...!!!

**Now what next..? (OPTIONAL)**

Yes. If you want to remove the aircel default dashboard with in your
data card follow this.

You are unlocked your device but still aircel dashboard within your
device. So aircel dashboard will be installed while you freshly
connected with any machine. Now we are going to change that to Huawei
Mobile partner dashboard. This is purely optional.

-   Extract
    thatÂ UTPS23.001.07.04.910_mobile_partner_dashboard_update.zip
-   Run the extracted exe file.
-   Plug your device.
-   Press start button.
