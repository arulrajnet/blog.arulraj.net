= AsciiDoctor with pelican

This article written in asciidoc format. Refer https://github.com/arulrajnet/blog.arulraj.net/blob/master/content/asciidoctor-with-pelican.adoc?plain=1[this source]

Asciidoc integration with Attila theme in pelican static site generator is in progress. So most of text formatting and syntax highlighting is not supported in this theme.

== Articles in asciidoc format with pelican static site generator

Refer by pelicanconf.py file. In the plugins section I have added `asciidoc_reader` plugin

[source,python]
-----------------
PLUGINS = [
  'sitemap',
  'neighbors',
  'related_posts',
  'post_stats',
  'assets',
  'asciidoc_reader'
]
-----------------

Then write this article with http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[asciidoctor] syntax and save this with .adoc extenstion.


== Examples

Here is the example about different components in asciidoc format.


=== Formatting

A bold *word*, and a bold *phrase of text*.

Bold c**hara**cter**s** within a word.


An italic _word_, and an italic _phrase of text_.

Italic c__hara__cter__s__ within a word.


"`Wait!`" Indigo plucked a small vial from her desk's top drawer
and held it toward us.
The vial's label read: `E=mc^2^`; the `E` represents _energy_,
but also pure _genius!_

The text [.underline]#underline me# is underlined.

Mark my words, #automation is essential#.

"`Well the H~2~O formula written on their whiteboard could be part
of a shopping list, but I don't think the local bodega sells
E=mc^2^,`" Lazarus replied.

The deepest body of water is Deep Creek Lake.^[citation{sp}needed]^

== Conclustion

I am not happy with the output.

* Code block is not well formatted.
* MathJax is not supported.
* Table is not well formatted.

Made few changes on the attila theme to support code highlight in asciidoc and added MathJax support.

But require lot of styling changes to make it better OR use asciidoctor.js to render the asciidoc content in the browser.

Need to support in my base theme. Lot of work.

Will add more features in the future in attila theme. Stay tuned.
