**Live Cricket Score From CricInfo on your Bash Terminal**

[![score_terminal](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aJzVV1AyHS4/VU4v696M-HI/AAAAAAAAWPc/iWGrzuIGMMc/s640/livecricketscore.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aJzVV1AyHS4/VU4v696M-HI/AAAAAAAAWPc/iWGrzuIGMMc/s1600/livecricketscore.png)

You are a hardcore cricket fan, want to get updated the score while
working ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„ . But bored to open a browser â‡’ goto cricinfo â‡’ goto
particular cricket match. Welcome, this script for you only.

## Why this Script..?

I am not the fan of cricket. But some of friends working as Linux
Administrators who is always looking black and white terminal, They want
to know the score. So I wrote a shellscript to get score from cricinfo.
Now they happily run this script in an another terminal and gets updated
about score.

## How to use..?

-   Download the file from github
    [livecricketscore.sh](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/arulrajnet/fb71169c35180f9d9abd%20%22Gist%20Link%20for%20LiveCricketScore%22)
-   Then copy that file in to /usr/bin/ folder
-   Run that `livecricketscore` from anywhere
-   It will ask for the which match score you want to know
-   Select the matcher number
-   It will continuously run untill you kill ( CTRL + C ) that

``` bash
wget --no-check-certificate https://gist.githubusercontent.com/arulrajnet/fb71169c35180f9d9abd/raw/livecricketscore.sh
chmod +x livecricketscore.sh
cp livecricketscore.sh /usr/bin/livecricketscore
sh /usr/bin/livcricketscore
```

You need to install xmllint if its not there already. To install xmllint
in ubuntu

``` bash
apt-get update
apt-get install libxml2-utils
```
